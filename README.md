## Why Linux for Embedded Systems?
There are many reasons for the rapid growth of embedded
Linux. 
To name a few:
- Royalties: Unlike traditional proprietary operating systems, Linux can be deployed without any royalties.
- Hardware Support: Linux supports a vast variety of hardware devices including all major and commonly used CPU architectures: ARM, Intel x86, MIPS, and PowerPC in their respective 32-bit and 64-bit variants.
- Networking: Linux supports a large variety of networking protocols. Besides the ubiquitous TCP/IP, virtually any other protocol on any physical medium is implemented.
- Modularity: A Linux OS stack is composed of many diﬀerent software packages. Engineers can customize the stack to make it exactly ﬁt their application.
- Scalability: Linux scales from systems with only one CPU and limited resources to systems featuring multiple CPUs with many cores, large memory footprints, several networking interfaces, and much more.
- Source Code: The source code for the Linux kernel, as well as for all software packages comprising a Linux OS stack, is openly available.
- Developer Support: Because of its openness, Linux has attracted a huge number of active developers, and those developers have quickly built support for new hardware.
- Commercial Support: An increasing number of hardware and software vendors, including all semiconductor manufacturers as well as many independent software vendors (ISV), are now oﬀering support for Linux through products and services.
- Tooling: Linux provides myriad tools for software development ranging from compilers for virtually any programming language to a steadily growing number of proﬁling and performance measurement tools important for embedded systems development.

and the important thing is that in our graduation project we didn't need to develop the device drivers for UART ,camera and many others and this decreased our development time
